When integrated into armor plating in larger amounts, they also risked turning the vessel into a giant warhead, something even less desirable. \r\n\r\nA solution was finally found. Tiny amounts of metallofullerenes would be integrated in conjunction with far larger quantities of graphene nanoribbons and then coated in powdered C-540 graphite. This process allowed the material to maintain structural durability whilst keeping mass down. The last and most ingenious addition was to incorporate fulleroferrocene into the metal beneath layers of electromechanical hull sheeting. This had the effect of turning the normally dangerous explosive reactions into kinetic energy, which could then be used to supplement the power supply to local nanoassemblers.',1,5,0,1,NULL,400000.0000,1,1147,3721,NULL,0),(30465,965,'Metallofullerene Plating Blueprint','',0,0.01,0,1,NULL,10000000.0000,1,1191,96,NULL,0),(30466,964,'Electromechanical Interface Nexus','When integrated into a starship with other components, an EMI Nexus is used to facilitate manual control over numerous electromechanical systems which, by default, run in an automated manner according to their programmed roles.

This process relies on digital relays from camera drones and monitoring systems embedded into the hull. After the data is captured, it is then relayed directly into the brain, at which point the external surrounds are recreated almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\nThe synthetic translation of external stimuli into neurovisual imagery is incredibly risky, even relative to the standard hazards of pod piloting. Even though capsuleers have an innate resistance to neurobiological damage from these sorts of processes, the near- constant exposure to them has been linked to increased risk of aggressive neurodegenerative diseases.

It was soon realized that lack of experience in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions.\r\n\r\nFrom this realization was born the concept of the Force Auxiliary capital ship, a vessel dedicated to ensuring the survival of more combat- and command-oriented capital ships such as Carriers and Titans. The Apostle-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned in memory of Empress Jamyl I and is richly decorated in token of this dedication.\r\n',1310000000,18135000,2175,1,4,1700000000.0000,1,2272,NULL,20062,21252),(37605,1538,'Minokawa','<i>\"The Amarr have decided that there\'s something to learn from the capsuleers when it comes to capital ships.

In large part this was due to a flaring up of the old debate between the firepower- and maneuver-oriented generals of the Brutor dominated military circles and the logistics- and fighter-oriented Sebiestor fleet tactician and technologist circles.\r\n\r\nAfter much chest-beating, and due in no small part to the intervention of Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor, the arguments of the Sebiestor won out and the Lif-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned over the objections of the Brutor military elite.\r\n',1260000000,14625000,3000,1,2,1700000000.0000,1,2275,NULL,20077,21256),(37607,1538,'Ninazu','<i>\"It is imperative that our Federation Navy capital ship fleets remain a match for any threat that may be posed by hostile entities or aggressive powers.
