It was soon realized that lack of experience in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions. From this realization was born the concept of the Force Auxiliary capital ship, a vessel dedicated to ensuring the survival of more combat- and command-oriented capital ships such as Carriers and Titans. The Apostle-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned in memory of Empress Jamyl I and is richly decorated in token of this dedication.',200,2,0,1,4,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,21252),(42521,226,'Amarr Providence Freighter','Even though characteristically last in the race to create a working prototype of new technology, the Empire\'s engineers spared no effort in bringing the Providence into the world.

construction nanites to return the targeted matter to its original state. Its on-board processor interfaces with a forward-facing sensor suite, instantly recognizing vehicles, devices, and personal armor based on microscopic manufacturer\'s tags. The beam, a bi-channel “hollow laser”, simultaneously acts as both a containment field and transport medium for the nanite swarm, which works to sift unwanted particles from the structure, undo ionization, and reconstruct the atomic patterns of the material. \n\nThe repair tool has several design innovations, the most surprising probably being the incorporation of Amarr focusing crystal technology. Beyond that, the device also makes use of an advanced K7 nano static co-processor on par with Caldari planet side missile tracking systems and a 55x5 reverse current power cell configuration rarely used beyond self-sustaining Gallente drone units.
