This is accomplished through a revolutionary “dust recapture” system that essentially vacuums the air around the drill head. The collected dust is captured in large, on-site filtration systems which then compacts the dust into blocks. These blocks can either be refined along with the extracted ores, or simply placed back into the mine as backfill once drilling operations are complete. While more than five times as expensive as normal drills, the efficiency of these new models provides an entirely new level of environmental protection.

Interestingly, the entire project took less than one year from start to finish, suggesting at some degree of urgency in the fleet\'s production.\r\n\r\nThe first of these vessels was awarded to Gallente pilot Jack DuVal on June 4th YC115 as a gesture of good will, after it was stolen from an Ishukone Watch shipyard in orbit of Caldari Prime by the Guristas Pirates, before being abandoned in his hangar in Korama after a lengthy pursuit across the Caldari Border Zone.\r\n \r\n<font color=white><u>Technology</u></font>\r\nThough the typical Scorpion-class battleship includes a highly advanced sensor package, Ishukone Watch modifies their ships for policing duty around their worlds. Custom multispectral radiation scanners designed to catch all forms of planetary and extra-planetary communications replace the standard comms suite. Special Ladar and thermal imaging equipment allow Ishukone Watch ships to serve as a distant eye-in-the-sky for planetary security forces.

The rogue drone hive found at the Skeleton Comet complex within the <a href=showinfo:5//30002681>Deltole</a> system appears to have assimilated ancient technologies left behind by the Yan Jung nation, resulting in the development of a new strain of drones, potentially more powerful than their standard counterparts. \r\n\r\nTwo reports on these events were gathered to determine the extent to which the drones were affected by assimilating the Yan Jung technology, and to establish what level of threat this could pose. The findings showed that the new strain of drones possess significantly enhanced communication systems and cognitive abilities as compared with their predecessors. However, through the examination process it was also discovered that apparently, nearly all of the new drone strains had been destroyed by the original rogue drone hive, likely due to self-regulatory mechanisms within the hive. Consequently, we conclude that any remaining drones pose little to no threat. \r\n\r\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the <a href=evebrowser: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan>Arek\'Jaalan Project.</a></i>\r\n\r\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek\'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>',1,0.1,0,1,4,NULL,1,NULL,33,NULL,0),(4326,1141,'Research Abstract: Project Enigma','<b>Paper:</b> Project Enigma - The Jovian Empires<br>\r\n<b>Lead Researcher:</b> Myyona<br>\r\n<b>Contributors:</b> None<br>\r\n<b>Summary:</b> The Jovian society was the first to recover after the closure of the EVE Gate, an event that caused a near-complete extinction of all human settlements in New Eden. Having existed for thousands of years since then, the Jovian Empire experienced peaks and falls long before any of the other currently existing empires even managed to establish themselves as spacefaring nations. \r\n\r\nBeing keen seekers of knowledge, the Jovians possess great insight on past events, though they do not share it freely and easily with outsiders. This paper looks into the documentation available on the history of the Jovian Empires in an attempt to better understand the Jove mentality and the current state of the Jovian society. Evidence gathered for the paper suggests that the recent lack of communication from Jovian officials, as well as their seeming inability to stop the fatal Jovian Disease, may signal that the current Jovian Empire is in decline.\r\n\r\n<i>This abstract relates to research undertaken by the Arek\'Jaalan Project.</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Authorized for capsuleer dissemination under the CONCORD Freedom of Distribution Act (Alpha-One-Five), YC 113.11.4</i>\r\n\r\n<i>Further copies of this document can be obtained through the Arek\'Jaalan administrative site, located in the <a href=showinfo:5//30003413>Eram</a> system.<i>',1,0.1,0,1,4,NULL,1,NULL,33,NULL,0),(4327,1141,'Research Abstract: Project Trinity','<b>Paper:</b> Project Trinity<br>\r\n<b>Lead Researcher:</b> Julianus Soter<br>\r\n<b>Contributors:</b> General Stargazer, Moira.

This brings up the question of how life originally came to planets in Anoikis.\r\n\r\nThe “molecular clock” method was used to estimate how long ago life in Anoikis and life in known space had a common ancestor. In the molecular clock method random changes to segments of “junk” DNA are examined and compared between organisms. Changes in these segments occur randomly, accumulate over time, and are not selected for by evolution. By seeing how different a given segment of junk DNA is between two organisms, an estimate can be made as to how long ago they had a common ancestor. \r\n\r\nFor this case, microorganisms that live in known space and those that live in Anoikis were compared. \r\n\r\nIt was found that life in Anoikis split from life in known space during the dark ages, the time period between the closure of the eve gate and the rebirth of civilization. Apparently, during this time, some space-faring civilization survived, or arose much faster than has been assumed. This civilization appears to have moved to Anoikis and made use of the planets.\r\n\r\nSome organisms were found that had a common ancestor with life in known space about a year ago.

The goals of the project are, relative to similar bodies, both simple to understand and quite humble. Put simply, our aim is to research, document and educate.\r\n\r\n<b>Research:</b> We aim to posit and debate theories, study known facts and uncover new ones, and use every other method available to deepen our understanding of the Sleepers and related subjects.\r\n\r\n<b>Document:</b> Through extensive use of open networks, and with the help of key staff, we aim to document all of the information shared between project members, from everyday communication to large-scale research projects.\r\n\r\n<b>Educate:</b> Using our body of contributors and their documented research as a foundation, we aim to educate other capsuleers about our work, and to encourage wider capsuleer interest in scientific matters by presenting information openly and accessibly.\r\n\r\nIn its initial phase, the project aims to build a “foundational” body of documented research, at which point a larger focus will begin to be placed on the goal of education.\r\n\r\nIt should be emphasized that Arek\'Jaalan does not aim to produce new technologies, and in particular that we take an active stance against any further weaponization of Sleeper or other technologies. We aim for something more benign and progressive.\r\n\r\nIt should be similarly noted that much of our work lies in centralizing and documenting scattered, yet publicly available, information. In the absence of these hard facts, we turn to educated theory. Although there is always the risk of information being used for immoral ends, it should be remembered what the majority of our work at the Arek\'Jaalan project actually amounts to, and that our own stance is to be firmly against such actions.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmingly, the current focus of interest in capsuleer research is applied science, particularly weaponization. The work we do is intended to help humanity, and science as a whole, not just the capsuleer military-industrial cycle. Arek\'Jaalan stands apart from the destructive mainstream; as an alternative way for capsuleers to use their unique capabilities.
